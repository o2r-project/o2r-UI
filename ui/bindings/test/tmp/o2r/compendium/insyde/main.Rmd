abstract: "Methodologies to estimate economic flood damages are increasingly important for flood risk assessment and management. In this work, we present a new synthetic flood damage model based on a component-by-component analysis of physical damage to buildings. The damage functions are designed using an expert-based approach with the support of existing scientific and technical literature, loss adjustment studies, and damage surveys carried out for past flood events in Italy. The model structure is designed to be transparent and flexible, and therefore it can be applied in different geographical contexts and adapted to the actual knowledge of hazard and vulnerability variables."
#&nbsp;The model has been tested in a recent flood event in northern Italy. Validation results provided good estimates of post-event damages, with similar or superior performances when compared with other damage models available in the literature. In addition, a local sensitivity analysis was performed in order to identify the hazard variables that have more influence on damage assessment results."

# Introduction
Flood damage evaluation today is a crucial component of any strategy for flood risk mitigation and management <!--(Messner and Meyer, 2006; Messner et al., 2007; Merz et al., 2010)-->.
In particular, models and methodologies for estimating economic damages are key for evaluating and comparing flood mitigation measures and for defining flood risk management plans.

<!--Available damage models can be classified into two main classes: empirical and synthetic models (Smith, 1994; Merz et al., 2010). Empirical models use damage datasets col- lected from past flood events to link vulnerability and haz- ard variables to damage (data-driven approaches), while-->
<!--Empirical and -->Synthetic models adopt a <!--more--> conceptual expert-based approach using hypotheses and assumptions about damage mechanisms (what-if analysis).
Synthetic damage models can be employed for a variety of applications <!--(e.g. Papathoma-Köhle et al., 2015)-->, such as the derivation of damage functions for different types of assets, post-event damage estimation, and analysis of uncertainty sources in damage assessments.

<!-- Despite their growing importance, there are still relevant issues in the application of flood damage models (Handmer, 2003; Meyer et al., 2013). First, the relative scarcity of observed damage data is often a relevant obstacle in developing and improving existing models. Models based on data-driven approaches are especially prone to this issue because they require specific calibration to be applied in different contexts (Merz et al., 2010; Bubeck and Kreibich, 2011). Synthetic models, adopting expert-based assumptions of hazard– damage relationships, are less dependent on datasets for model derivation, though they still require additional data for calibration and validation (Smith, 1994; Merz et al., 2010). Second, even when reliable and comprehensive datasets are available, it is generally not possible to extrapolate adequate damage functions due to the well-known complexity of damage mechanisms (Andrè et al., 2013; Cammerer et al., 2013; Scorzini and Frank, 2015). Damage computation methods based on probabilistic approaches might offer a solution to this issue (Schröter et al., 2014), yet this research topic is still relatively unanswered in literature. Third, the evaluation of flood mitigation measures requires methodologies for estimating economic damages at both the micro-scale (e.g. building-scale strategies for vulnerability reduction) and the mesoscale (e.g. spatial planning strategies) (Schröter et al., 2014). When micro-scale strategies are considered, empirical models are less suitable because the model structure generally considers few explicative variables. For residential buildings these typically include the water depth, the building structure, and the number of floors (Messner and Meyer, 2006; Schröter et al., 2014); as a consequence, it is not possible to evaluate the effect of the full range of mitigation strategies available, such as the use of permeable materials, the moving of vulnerable components, etc. Synthetic models can overcome this limitation since their level of complexity can be designed to adapt to the required detail. -->
Still, subjectivity in what-if analyses may result in uncertain damage estimates <!--(Gissing and Blong, 2004)-->. 
In addition, these models are often affected by a lack of transparency, which limits their applicability and transferability, as well as possible improvements <!--(Scorzini and Frank, 2015)-->. 
Indeed, in many cases the rationale behind model development (e.g. assumptions, mechanisms considered, built-in parameters) is not clearly presented and relevant variables to be used are not well explained.

<!--Given this framework,-->In this paper we propose a probabilistic methodology to derive synthetic damage curves for residential buildings called INSYDE (In-depth Synthetic Model for Flood Damage Estimation). 
The method is based on an explicit component-by-component analysis of physical damages to buildings, which takes into account available knowledge on damage mechanisms. 
INSYDE is transparent and can be applied in different contexts. 
Implemented functions and values are clearly explained so that they can be totally or partly modified according to the physical context in which the model is applied. 
Conversely, the methodology allows for different levels of detail in the analysis, hence the damage model can be adapted to the actual knowledge of relevant hazard and vulnerability variables.

The damage functions composing the model have been designed using an expert-based approach with the support of existing scientific and technical literature, loss adjustment studies, and damage surveys carried out for past flood events in Italy. 
It is important to note that the current version presented in this paper is limited to residential building damage estimation. 
The general methodology, however, can be extended to other types of assets, such as commercial or industrial buildings.
<!--Subsequently, the model was validated against loss data collected for a recent flood event in northern Italy and compared pared with the results provided by several damage models in the literature. Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the model hazard parameters in order to explore in more detail the model behaviour and quantify the influence of each hazard parameter. The results and relevant findings are dis- cussed in order to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model.-->

# Model description
INSYDE adopts a synthetic approach consisting of the simulated, step-by-step inundation of residential buildings, and in the evaluation of the corresponding damage based on building and hazard features. 
Such a methodology can also be referred to as a what-if analysis.

Damages are first modelled on a component-by-component basis using physically based mathematical functions and are then converted into monetary terms using full replacement costs derived from reference price lists. 
The overall economic damage to each building <!--D--> is obtained by summing <!--each of the different damage components Ci as fol- lows: where Ci includes--> each of the different damage components clean-up and removal costs, structural damage, non-structural damage, damage to finishing elements, damage to windows and doors, and damage to building systems<!-- , and n is the total number of components used to define the damage. Each component Ci is subdivided into mi different subcomponents Cij , specifically referring to the reparation of the damaged elements or to their removal and replacement. The complete list of components and subcom- ponents is presented in Table 1-->.

For each subcomponent, a mathematical function describing the damage mechanism and associated cost is formulated, considering expert-based knowledge as well as available technical and scientific documentation. 
The general formulation can be described as follows: 
event features include all the physical variables describing the flood event at the building location, e.g. maximum external and internal water depth, flood duration, water quality (presence of contaminants) and sediment load. 
Building characteristics include all the variables that describe features and geometry of the building. 
Building features affect damage estimation either by modifying the functions describing damage mechanisms (e.g. system distribution, building structure) or by affecting the unit prices of the building components by a certain factor (e.g. building type, finishing level). 
Conversely, the geometrical properties of the building (e.g. footprint area, number of floors) are used in the estimation of the extension of damage to each of the building components. 
Unit prices refer to the cost of replacement or reparation of the building components per unit of measure (e.g. door removal cost per square metre, pavement replacement cost per square metre).
<!--For the present study, unit prices are derived from Italian price lists for the year 2013 (default values are shown in Table S1 in the Supplement).-->
The cost for each subcomponent is determined by the unit price (up) and the extension (ext). 
The latter is the measure of the physical dimension of the damage (e.g. m2 of plaster damaged) and depends on the event features and building characteristics.
<!--We can therefore refer to...-->

This distinction is useful for model generalization. 
The extension of the damage is determined only by the physical effects that the flood event causes to the building; 
therefore, the same approach can be applied in different countries or geographic areas, provided that the local characteristics of the buildings are accounted for. 
Unit prices, instead, vary from country to country or even within a country, they can also be referred to standard or default unit prices in official publications. 
Therefore, local price values are well identified and can be easily replaced with more suitable ones in this approach.

Tables <!--2 and 3-->1 and 2 describe in detail the event features and building characteristics parameters, their unit of measurement, their range, and the default values in case no informa- tion is supplied to the model.
<!--When some of the input data are missing, another option available in the model is to sample these parameters from distributions, which also allows uncertainty analysis in input data. 
The damage functions and the general assumptions for all the damage subcomponents are reported in the Supplement, while Table 1 synthesizes the event features and building characteristics considered for each subcomponent function.-->
The variables listed in Tables <!--2 and 3-->1 and 2 can directly affect damage estimation in terms of extension or indirectly by influencing other variables. 
An example of the latter case is YY (year of construction), which <!--, as shown in Table 1,--> has no direct impact on the damage mechanisms of the different building subcomponents but indirectly influences the selection of other variables such as PD (heating system distribution) and PT (heating system type). 
Another example is NF (number of floors), which only directly affects soil consolidation despite indirectly influencing many other building components because damage on upper floors can only occur if the floors actually exist in the building. 
The number of flooded floors is then calculated as a function of inundation depth and interfloor height of the building (IH).
<!--Long section about uncertainty-->

It is important to underline that during the model design, observed damage data were essentially used to analyse the relations between hazard parameters and damage mechanisms in order to improve physical damage functions.
For instance, the functions for structural damage found in literature were implemented in the model after some modifications, as they were not in line with the observed damages. 
Such a usage is consistent with an expert-based approach because observed data were first interpreted and then used to modify parts of the model structure rather than applied to calibrate the parameters of existing functions.

Figure<!--s 2 and--> 1 provides an example of damage functions developed for a default building in the case of a flood with a duration = 24 h, flow velocity = 0.5 m/s, sediment concentration = 0.05, and presence of pollutants (water quality = 1).

<!--# Sensitivity analysis
The damage dataset used to validate the model in Sect. 3 did not allow full investigation of the model behaviour. The limited total flood extent and the slow flow processes that occurred in the study area resulted in low values of hazard variables like water depth, flow velocity, and sediment load. Therefore, the test did not allow assessment of the influence of these parameters in determining the damage, that is the sensitivity of the model structure to high values of the hazard variables. 
To further explore the importance of each of <!--these the parameters the hazard variables like water depth, flow velocity, and sediment load, we performed a local sensitivity analysis. 
In this application, the damage was computed by varying alternately each hazard parameter while the others were kept constant. 
The building characteristics variables have not been analysed at this stage.<!--, nor has the uncertainty related with the probabilistic modelling of some of the damage mechanisms (see Sect. 5 for a more detailed discussion).

Two different flood conditions have been considered to explore the model behaviour in different conditions: 
a low velocity, long duration flood and, conversely, a high velocity, short duration flood event. 
For the first case, the fixed values of depth, velocity, duration, and sediment load were respectively h = 1.5 m, v = 1.0 m/s, d = 24 h and s = 0.10.
For the second case, the values were h = 2.0 m, v = 2.0 m/s, d = 10 h and s = 0.10. 

Computations were performed considering a standard reinforced concrete building with two floors and a basement, 100 m\textsuperscript{2} of floor area, and a high finishing level. 
The other building characteristics were set using the previously mentioned default values. 

Figures <!--5 and 6/ 2 and 3 summarize the results of the local sensitivity analysis in the two chosen flood conditions, showing the relative influence of each hazard variable in determining the total economic damage. 
As expected, water depth is the most influential parameter since all the damage functions directly depend on it. 
Relative changes in flood duration have much more impact in low velocity, long duration events, while the relevance of velocity is more evident at higher values, when structural damages can become important. 
In both scenarios sediment load has a relatively marginal importance. 
The influence of water quality q is not included in Figs. <!--4 and 5/ 2 and 3 because it is a binary variable and, therefore, cannot be increased or decreased incrementally and directly compared with the other variables. 
Both base cases were thus computed considering the absence of pollutants (q = 0). 
To illustrate the influence of this hazard variable on model results, we computed the same two base cases separately considering the presence of pollutants (q = 1). 
The resulting relative increase in damage for the presence of pollutants ranges from around 30 to 45 %.-->
